# ReproducibleFAIR

## What is the purpose of this repository ?

This GitHub repository serves as an illustration of an attempt to create a reproducible and F.A.I.R (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) statistical analysis and is associated with an article whose reference will be added soon in this section. The analysis is performed on public NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data collected between 1999 and 2012. You can find the database [here](https://nhanes.hms.harvard.edu/). 
_More information on CDC NHANES [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm)._

Both reproducibility and “fairness” concepts are relevant and complementary. They promote a more open, discoverable and credible science. For this reason, they should ideally be strived for by any researchers.

## Reproducibility

By publishing a repository with an Apache 2 license, you can make use of every element of the repository. The query of data is detailed in the ipynb file.
You can also execute the code by clicking this button : [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hms-dbmi/ReproducibleFAIR/master) and share it via this link https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hms-dbmi/ReproducibleFAIR/master
(_The loading of the page might take up to ten minutes. Feel free to click on the "show" button to make sure that the process of building logs is on if it is taking too much time. Note that he loading might even fail from time to time. This might be viewed as an environment's alternative to execute the code and not as a completely reliable way to reproduce a computationnal work_ )
If you want to execute the code in your own R console; you also have the opportunity to directly download the code (R_code_of_the_statistical_analysis.R).

_More information about the reproducibility aspects are provided in the article that will be soon associated with this repository._

## FAIR compliance

Having a unique identifier and rich metadata that describe the digital object are the most essential part on how to achieve "fairness". We associated a DOI to the repository by using [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
